# pacman

A processing (Java based) implementation of pacman, with the ghosts activelly chasing pacman (not following pre-determined routes), several difficulty levels, semi-random maps, and lots of cheat codes!

Unfortunately, the inferface is in Portuguese, as this project was part of a programming class of University of Aveiro (Portugal).
